## Deployment errors

#### The certificate that is attached to your distribution doesn't cover the alternate domain name (CNAME) that you're trying to add.

By default, ShipFast.dev creates certificate that supports `*.[ENV_STAGE].[HOSTED_ZONE_NAME]` domains
(e.g. `*.production.example.com`). If you want to override this behaviour and name your domain differently
(e.g. `example.com`) then you can override this behaviour be setting `SHIPFAST_CERTIFICATE_DOMAIN` variable:

```
pnpm shipfast aws set-var SHIPFAST_CERTIFICATE_DOMAIN example.com
```
